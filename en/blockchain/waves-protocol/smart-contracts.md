Ride4DApps is an update of RIDE language which main goal is to enable classic 'DApps' approach on Acryl by adding the ability to define and call functions in a contract. This feature is not available on the mainnet yet, but IDE supports new language syntax and allows to compile and deploy contracts to the testnet or your custom chain.
