# Transaction binary format

A **transaction binary format** is a set of fields of a [transaction](/blockchain/transaction.md).

Transactions of different [types](/blockchain/transaction-type.md) have different binary formats.

Transactions of the same type, but of different [versions](/blockchain/transaction/transaction-version.md), also have different binary formats.
