# dApp

A **dApp** (from _decentralised application_) is an account on the Waves platform with a [dApp script](/blockchain/dapp-script.md) attached to it.

In the global sense, dApp is an application that runs in a decentralised computer system, for example, on the blockchain.

In the context of the Waves platform, dApp is a [RIDE script](/ride/ride-script.md) that is stored and executed on the Waves blockchain nodes.
