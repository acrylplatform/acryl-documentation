# Transaction body bytes

The **transaction body bytes** are the bytes of all the fields of a [binary representation](/blockchain/binary-format/transaction-binary-format.md) of a transaction with the exception of `id`, `signature` and `proofs` fields.

Based on the transaction body bytes, the [transaction ID](/blockchain/transaction/transaction-id.md) and the [transaction signature](/blockchain/transaction/transaction-signature.md) are generated.
