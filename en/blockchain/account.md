# Account

An **account** is a mathematically bound pair of a public and a private keys.

> A pair is considered an account if the public key of the pair has participated in at least one [transaction](/blockchain/transaction.md) in the [blockchain](/blockchain/blockchain.md), i.e. it was recorded to at least one [block](/blockchain/block.md)

Each account has a _single_ [address](/blockchain/address.md).

Each account has an [account data storage](/blockchain/account-data-storage.md).
