# Account script

An **account script** is a [RIDE script](/ride/ride-script.md) that has the following directives:

``` ride
{-# CONTENT_TYPE EXPRESSION #-}
{-# SCRIPT_TYPE ACCOUNT #-}
```

Account script is attached to an [account](/blockchain/account.md) with a set script transaction.

An [account](/blockchain/account.md) with the attached script is called a [smart account](/blockchain/smart-account.md).
