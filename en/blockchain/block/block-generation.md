# Block generation

A **block generation** is a creation of a new [block](/blockchain/block.md) on the [blockchain](/blockchain/blockchain.md).

Blocks are generated by [mining nodes](/blockchain/mining/mining-node.md) according to the FPoS [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)) algorithm and the Waves-NG protocol.
