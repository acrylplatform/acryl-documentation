# Transaction

A **transaction** is an action on behalf of an [account](/blockchain/account.md).

Transactions can be sent _only_ from an account: thus, any transaction can be associated with some account.

There are several [transaction types](/blockchain/transaction-type.md) on the Waves blockchain.
