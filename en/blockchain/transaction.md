# Transaction

A **transaction** is an action on the [blockchain](/blockchain.md) on behalf of an [account](/blockchain/account.md).

Transactions can be sent _only_ from an account â€” thus, any transaction can be associated with some account.

There are several [transaction types](/blockchain/transaction-type.md).

Each transaction has a [unique ID](/blockchain/transaction/transaction-id.md) and [timestamp](/blockchain/transaction/transaction-timestamp.md).
