# REPL

**REPL** ([_read–eval–print loop_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)) is a console of the [Waves IDE](/developer-tools/waves-ide.md).

The console allows:

* sign and send [transactions](/blockchain/transaction.md)
* retrieve information about account balance
* read data from [account data storage](/blockchain/account-data-storage.md)
* send and cancel orders on DEX

You can write in the console any JavaScript code, including one that makes calls to the methods of the TypeScript library [Waves Transactions](https://github.com/wavesplatform/waves-transactions). The documentation on the Waves Transactions is available on [GitHub](https://wavesplatform.github.io/waves-transactions/).

The console also has [objects and methods](https://wavesplatform.github.io/js-test-env/modules/globalenv.html) for accessing the environment of the Waves IDE.
