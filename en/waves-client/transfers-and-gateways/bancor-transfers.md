## Introduction

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Bancor on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Bancors are sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Bancor token \(wBNT\) issued in the Waves blockchain. Every single Bancor token is backed 1:1 with the real Bancor.

## How to receive Bancor

The following window will appear. Before proceeding please carefully read the conditions:

**Once the transaction is confirmed, the gateway will process the transfer of Bancor to a token in your Waves account.**
```
Enter this address into your Bancor client or wallet.
```
**The minimum amount of deposit is **0.1 Bancor**, the maximum amount of deposit is **50 000 Bancor**
```
If you will send less than 0.1 Bancor, you will lose that money.
```

Copy the shown Bancor address or Scan QR Code and send a payment.

## How to use sponsored fee

Waves users can also use a sponsored fee to pay for outgoing transfers. Check your **Portfolio**, if you see a token with **%** icon. So it means you can change the default Waves fee to another sponsored token.

So how to do it? Just create an outgoing transfer described above and click on the **WAVES** under **Transaction Fee**.
Choose an available sponsored token and click on the **Continue** button.
