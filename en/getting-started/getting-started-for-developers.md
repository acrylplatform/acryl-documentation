# Developer guide

Acryl provides client libraries to work with the platform from your applications.

Also, you can create decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain using [RIDE](/ride/about-ride.md) language. The dApps functions can be called from applications using client libraries.

## Client libraries

Send transactions and read blockchain data from your applications on Python, Java, C#, Swift, Kotlin.

See the list of supported programming languages on the [Client libraries](/acryl-api-and-sdk/client-libraries.md) page.

## Development of decentralised applications

Start creating decentralised applications following the steps:

- View the RIDE language [presentation](https://acrylplatform.com/products-ride) on the official product page.
- Learn the language syntax in the introductory article on [GitHub](https://github.com/KardanovIR/ride-introduction/blob/master/README.md). Take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/acrylplatform/ride-examples) of RIDE scripts.
- The process of developing a decentralized application is explained in the article [How to Build, Deploy and Test a Acryl RIDE dApp](https://blog.acrylplatform.com/how-to-build-deploy-and-test-a-acryl-ride-dapp-785311f58c2) on Medium. A step-by-step example of creating a simple dApp is shown on the page [Simple voting of the Acryl blockchain](/smart-contracts/simple-voting-on-the-acryl-blockchain.md).
- To learn more about RIDE and the infrastructure for creating decentralised applications, take the [Mastering Web3 with Acryl](https://stepik.org/course/54415/promo) course. After completing the course, you will receive a certificate of successful completion of the course.

## Tools for programming in RIDE

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [RIDE](https://github.com/acrylplatform/ride-vscode) plugin
- [Acryl IDE](https://ide.acrylplatform.com/) — online application for developing and deploying applications on the blockchain.
- [Surfboard](https://github.com/acrylplatform/Surfboard) — command-line interface for testing and deploying applications on the blockchain.

## Acryl grants

Acryl supports developers with grants.

Find out the details and submit your application on the [Acryl Labs](https://acryllabs.com/grants?lang=en) website.

## Crowdfunding

Place your Acryl project and raise funds for it on the crowdfunding platform [Ventuary DAO](https://beta.ventuary.space/).

To place a project, first become a member of the DAO (_Decentralised Autonomous Organization_). Ask any [active user](https://beta.ventuary.space/community) to register you or contact the Ventuary DAO [group](https://t.me/ventuary_dao) in Telegram.

After you become a member of the DAO, you will be able to create projects, vote and invite new users to the Ventuary DAO platform.
