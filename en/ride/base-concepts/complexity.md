# Script complexity

**Script complexity** is a dimensionless quantity that estimates computational resources needed to execute a [script](/ride/script.md).

The complexity of a script is estimated based on complexities of all the [operators](/ride/operators.md) and [functions](/ride/functions.md) it consists of.

The complexity of a script can be seen in the [Acryl IDE](https://ide.acrylplatform.com); it is currently limited to 4000:
