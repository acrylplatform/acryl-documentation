# About RIDE

**RIDE** is a functional programming language based on expressions.

RIDE is used to write [RIDE scripts](/ride/ride-script.md).

The language:

* has a [strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing)Â [static typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking)
* has no loops, recursions and goto-like expressions, and therefore is not [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)
* is [lazy](/ride/immutable-variables.md) by design

## IDE

As an IDE for writing RIDE scripts, you can use the [Waves IDE](/developer-tools/waves-ide.md) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [waves-ride](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wavesplatform.waves-ride) extension installed.

## The history of creation

RIDE was created in 2018. The [white paper](https://wavesplatform.com/files/docs/white_paper_waves_smart_contracts.pdf) of the language was published at that time also.
