# About RIDE

**RIDE** is a functional programming language based on [expressions](/ride/base-concepts/expression.md).

RIDE is used for writing [scripts](/ride/script.md).

The language:

* has a [strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing)Â [static typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking)
* has no loops, recursions and goto-like expressions, and therefore is not [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)
* is [case-sensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity)

## IDE

Use [Waves IDE](/smart-contracts/tools/waves-ide.md) or Visual Studio Code with the [RIDE extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wavesplatform.waves-ride) for writing scripts.

## The history of creation

RIDE was created in 2018. The [white paper](https://wavesplatform.com/files/docs/white_paper_waves_smart_contracts.pdf) of the language was published at that time also.
