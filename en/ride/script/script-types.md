# Script types

There are three types of [scripts](/ride/script.md):

* [Account script](/ride/script/script-types/account-script.md)
* [Asset script](/ride/script/script-types/asset-script.md)
* [dApp script](/ride/script/script-types/dapp-script.md)

The script type is defined by the `SCRIPT_TYPE` [directive](/ride/script/directives.md).
