# Functions

A function has to return a value.

The return type is not specified in a function's signature.

A function has to be defined above the place of its usage.

## Examples

Definition of a function with no parameters that returns the integer:

```ride
func main() = {
   3
}
```

Definition of a function with two parameters:

```ride
func main(amount: Int, name: String) = {
   throw()
}
```
