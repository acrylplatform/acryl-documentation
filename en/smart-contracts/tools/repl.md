You can write in the console any JavaScript code.

The console has built-in functions which you can use to:

* sign and send [transactions](/blockchain/transaction.md)
* get account balance
* read data from [account data storage](/blockchain/account/account-data-storage.md)

The documentation on the console functions is available on [GitHub](https://acrylplatform.github.io/js-test-env).
